        For example, let's say lst is [3, 4, 4] and chars is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']. 
        The for loop will iterate through the lst and for the first iteration x=3, 
        so chars[x] is 'd', which is then converted to a string and added to word, 
        which now becomes 'd'. The next iteration x=4, so chars[x] is 'e', which is 
        then added to word, which now becomes 'de'. The final result will be 'de'.
